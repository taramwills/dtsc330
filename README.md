# HW 2

How do you fill in the missing dates from the grants data?
    - Made loop to look at range of missing dates
        ○ Rows 65925-70459
    - Trouble finding pattern
        ○ Out of order
    - Decided to use the average date for NaNs
        ○ Looked for last dates entered between NaNs and filled in midpoint date

PI_NAMEs contains multiple names. We can only connect individual people. Can you make it so that we can get "grantees"?
Split PI_NAMES into different rows using pandas
    - Clean pi names
        ○ Remove (contact)
        ○ Get rid of whitespace
        ○ Determine delimiters
    - Split pi names into list of individual names
        ○ Used explode() to create one row per investigator
    - Removed empty/missing entries and retained application ID between each person and their grant
    - Create normalized grantees table with one person per row

The dates for Articles are problematic. Can you fix them?
    - Look at how dates are formatted
    - Determine what tag we're parsing
        ○ PubDate vs. others
    - If PubDate tag: extra loop
        ○ If tags are month, day, year: save into variable
Format into year-month-day

# HW 3
- Read in har (first 10 participants) and reusable classifier files
- Converted the timestamp data into a timeseries so that I could resample the data
- Determined unique participants
- For each person, computed acceleration magnitude using acc_x, acc_y, acc_y
- Resampled into 10 or 60 second intervals
- Determined features (acc_mag) and labels (is_sleep)
- Used first participants as test set and remaining in training set
- After loop, read in classifier using random forest model type
- Train features and labels
- Predict test features
- Print out accuracy
- 60s: 0.5862884160756501
- 10s: 0.6007462686567164

# HW 4
After implementing XGBoost to my reusable classifier, these are the new accuracies:
10s: 
Correct: 1484 / 2412
Accuracy: 0.615257048092869

60s:
Correct: 242 / 423
Accuracy: 0.5721040189125296
The 10s interval became slight more accurate and the 60s interval became slightly less accurate.
